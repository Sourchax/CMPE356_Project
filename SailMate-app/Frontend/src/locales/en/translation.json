      {
        "question": "How do I book a ferry ticket with SailMate?",
        "answer": "Booking with SailMate is easy! Visit our homepage and use the booking form to enter your departure and arrival locations, preferred dates, and number of passengers. Once logged in to your account, you can select your preferred sailing time, choose additional services, and complete your payment securely. After confirmation, your e-ticket will be sent to your email address and also be available in your account dashboard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel or change my reservation?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can cancel or change your reservation up to 24 hours before departure. To do so, visit the 'Check Ticket' or 'Cancel Ticket' sections of our website and enter your booking reference number. For cancellations, refunds are processed according to our policy: full refund if cancelled 7+ days before departure, 75% refund for 3-6 days prior, and 50% refund for 1-2 days before departure. Changes are subject to availability and may incur additional fees if the new fare is higher."
      },
      {
        "question": "How early should I arrive before departure?",
        "answer": "We recommend arriving at least 45 minutes before scheduled departure for foot passengers, and at least 90 minutes for vehicle passengers. This allows sufficient time for check-in, security procedures, and boarding. During high season (June-August) or on holiday dates, consider arriving 30 minutes earlier than the recommended times to avoid any delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to print my ticket or can I use a mobile ticket?",
        "answer": "SailMate supports both printed and mobile tickets. For most routes, you can show your e-ticket on your smartphone or tablet during check-in. The QR code on your ticket will be scanned for verification. If you prefer a printed ticket, you can print the PDF attachment in your confirmation email. We recommend having a digital backup even if you bring a printed copy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens in case of bad weather or cancellations?",
        "answer": "In case of cancellations due to severe weather conditions or technical issues, we will inform you as soon as possible via email and SMS. You will be offered the option to rebook on the next available sailing at no additional cost or receive a full refund, regardless of your ticket type. For significant delays (more than 2 hours), we provide complimentary refreshments at our terminals. We recommend checking our website or contacting our customer service for real-time updates during adverse weather conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there Wi-Fi on board?",
        "answer": "Yes, free Wi-Fi is available on all our ferries. Connection quality may vary depending on your location at sea. Premium high-speed Wi-Fi can be purchased onboard for passengers who need faster connections for work or streaming. Most vessels also have charging stations in common areas for your devices. During busy travel times, bandwidth may be limited due to high usage."
